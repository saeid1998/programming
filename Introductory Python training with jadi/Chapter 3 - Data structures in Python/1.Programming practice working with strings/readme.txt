Saman has just learned how to work with threads. To start working with strings, he has a relatively simple question in front of him, but he needs your help to be able to do it. Saman must write a program to read a string from the input and apply the following changes to it.



1- Delete all the vowels.

2- Print a dot before each silent letter.

3- Write all the remaining silent letters in lowercase.

(vowels are aeiou)


Sample input:

aBAcAba


Sample output:

.b.c.b
