On the occasion of Nowruz, three old friends want to meet each other. Azarmehr, Azargun and Mehrayin plan to meet at the same place. The house of these three people is located on the right line (x-axis), Azarmehr's house is located at point x1, Azargun's house is located at point x2, and Mehraiin's house is located at point x3. They want to cover the least distance in total. With x1 x2 x3 in hand, calculate the shortest distance these three must travel in total to meet at the same point. Please, if the answer is a correct number, print it without the decimal point, for example, in the example below, if you print 6.0, it is wrong.

Make sure that the desired distance is not the place where they are supposed to meet.
