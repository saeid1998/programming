Aryamanesh (also the name of Dariush's son) is very sad that when they write a word on the internet, they use both uppercase and lowercase letters. For this reason, he decided to write a browser that would write words that have both lowercase and uppercase letters in a new way, in such a way that if a word has more uppercase letters than the number of lowercase letters, it will write the whole word in uppercase letters otherwise. This form writes the whole word in small letters.
