Mr. Jubin Artabaz is the president of the United Nations and you are going to vote on the election of the board of directors! Dammehr Jamshidi, who is in charge of the United Nations computer, wrote a program that counts how many votes each country has won. You are going to write a program to help Dodamhar to count the votes.

The first line of the input contains the number n, which displays the total number of votes. Each of the next n lines contains the name of a country. Country names are made of lowercase English letters.

In the output, print m lines that contain the number of votes of each country. Write the names of the countries in alphabetical order in the output. See sample input and sample output for more information.

Note: The online arbitration system uses Python 3.4, in this version the dictionaries do not remember the order of entering information and may not achieve the desired result if they are sorted, to solve this problem, use OrderedDict instead of dict. You can import this data structure from the collections library in the program.

Sample input:

5
sarah
Hamid
Ali
sarah
sarah

Sample output:

Ali 1
Hamid 1
Sarah 3
