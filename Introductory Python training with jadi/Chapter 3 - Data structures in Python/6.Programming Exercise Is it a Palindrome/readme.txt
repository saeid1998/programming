Zargisu, who is new to programming, wants to write a program to determine whether a word is a palindrome or not. A word is called a palindrome that can be read either from the left or from the right. For example, Madam is a palindrome, but Tehran is not a palindrome. Now you have to help Zargisu to write this program.
Please note that it does not matter if the letters are small or large, as we said, Madam is a palindrome, just as maDAM is a palindrome.

Sample output:

Tehran
