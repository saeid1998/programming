Somia is studying in the second grade of primary school and is just learning to add numbers. The class teacher writes the sum of a series of numbers on the board and the students must calculate the sum of the desired numbers. To make it easier, the numbers to be added are only one, two and three. But this is not enough and students can only do the addition when the numbers are arranged in non-descending order (i.e. first ones then twos and then threes) you have to read the expression written by the teacher on the board as input and generate the explained expression in the output so that Sumiya and other students can calculate it.

Sample input:

1+1+3+1+3

Sample output:

1+1+1+3+3
