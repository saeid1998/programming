Write a program that reads some positive numbers from the input and prints its square root up to 4 decimal places.

The first line of input shows the number n, which is the number of numbers whose square root you need to calculate. Each of the next n lines contains a positive number. See input and output examples for more information. Tips: In this exercise, you must use the math library and the sqrt function from that library.

Please note that the output should not be rounded. Print exactly 4 digits after the decimal point.
