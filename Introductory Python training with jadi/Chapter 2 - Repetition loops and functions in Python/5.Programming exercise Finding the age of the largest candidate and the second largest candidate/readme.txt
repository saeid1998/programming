Write a program that reads the age of the candidates of the Islamic Council from the input and prints the age of the oldest and the second oldest in the output. Your program will continue to read from the input until a negative number of one is entered. As soon as this number appears in the input, the program should stop reading the input and print the largest age. The age of people ranges from 10 to 90 years. It is guaranteed that the age of the candidates will be the same at the entrance (that is, no two people will have the same age at the entrance).
