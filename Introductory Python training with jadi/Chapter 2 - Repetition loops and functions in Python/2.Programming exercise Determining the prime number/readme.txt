In this program, read a positive number from the input and determine if it is prime or not.
Definition of prime number: It is not divisible by any other number except one and itself. For example, 7 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 7. The number 6 is not prime because apart from 1 and 6, it is also divisible by 2 and 3.

If it is a prime number, print the expression "prime" in the output, and if it is not a prime number, print the expression "not prime" in the output. Please make sure that the output is exactly as stated. Small letters are important.
