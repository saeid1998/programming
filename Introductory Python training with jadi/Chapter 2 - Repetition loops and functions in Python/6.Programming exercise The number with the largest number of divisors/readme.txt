Write a program that reads 20 numbers from the input and at the end prints the number with the highest number of divisors along with the number of divisors in the output. If there are several numbers in this state, print the largest one.

One of the goals of the questions from now on is to use the function. Wherever you feel you can write part of the code as a separate function, do this. For this question, write a function that receives a number as input and prints the number of divisors of that number in the output. Then use this function in your program.
