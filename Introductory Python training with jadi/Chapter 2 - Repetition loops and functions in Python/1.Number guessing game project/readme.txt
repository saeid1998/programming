The steps of the game are as follows:

First, the user selects a number in his mind and does not tell the computer this number (does not give the number to the computer as an input) (a number between 1 and 99)

We run the program

The program guesses a number and prints it

The printed number creates three states

1- Or it is bigger than the number you have in your mind, which you tell the program by typing the letter k that the number in your mind is smaller than the number printed by the program, and the program should guess and display another number, etc. (It should be noted that in this case, by typing k, the program must guess a smaller number than its previous guess so that the game ends sooner)

2-Or if the printed number is smaller than the number you have in your mind, you tell the program with the uppercase letter b that the number in your mind is bigger than the number printed by the program and the program should guess another number. show and... (It should be noted that in this case, by typing b, the program must guess a number larger than its previous guess so that the game ends sooner)

3- Or the printed number is the same number that was in your mind and by typing the letter d you tell the program that it guessed correctly and the program ends.
